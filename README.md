WestWorld
=========

A demonstration of Finite State Machines (FSM) where agents inhabit an Old West style gold mining town called West World.  This is VB.NET code and special credit is due to Mat Buckland for which the original C++ code comes from in his book.  You can find out more information here: http://www.ai-junkie.com/books/toc_pgaibe.html

Unfortunately, I was unable to get the files uploaded here.  Uploading simply proved to be a task beyond my ability to reason.  However, since its incredibly simpler I will make a post available over on Codeproject.com. Look for 'WestWorld'.  Thanks.
